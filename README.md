Tasks:

Calculate basic sales metrics: total revenue, average order value, and total sales.

Visualize trends using line and bar charts (e.g., monthly sales trends).

Identify top 3 products by sales and visualize them in a bar chart.

Tool Used: Google Sheets

Highlights:

Summarized sales metrics for easy reporting.

Identified best-selling products for strategic focus.

Created visual dashboards for quick insights.

Project 2: Employee Demographic Analysis

Objective: Understand the demographic distribution of employees in a company.

Tasks:

Analyze distribution of employees across departments.

Visualize gender split and age distribution using pie charts and histograms.

Identify average salary by department.

Tool Used: Excel

Highlights:

Provided department-wise employee insights.

Highlighted gender and age distributions for HR planning.

Calculated average salaries for salary benchmarking.

Project 3: Monthly Sales Trends and Analysis

Objective: Identify sales trends over time.

Dataset: Medium-sized sales dataset with columns: Date, Product, Quantity, Region.

Tasks:

Calculate monthly sales totals and visualize them in a line chart.

Identify best and worst months for sales.

Analyze sales by region using a bar chart.

Tool Used: Python (Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib)

Highlights:

Detected seasonal and regional sales trends.

Visualized top-performing and underperforming months.

Helped in inventory and marketing planning.

Project 4: Employee Attrition Insights

Objective: Analyze basic attrition patterns.

Dataset: IBM HR Analytics Dataset.

Tasks:

Calculate attrition rate.

Visualize attrition by department using a bar chart.

Identify average age of employees leaving the company.

Tool Used: Python (Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib)

Highlights:

Quantified overall attrition for workforce planning.

Department-wise attrition analysis for HR interventions.

Age analysis to identify retention strategies.

Project 5: Sales Predictions Using Basic Models

Objective: Predict future sales using trends.

Dataset: Dataset with columns: Date, Product, Quantity, Price.

Tasks:

Perform basic trend analysis to project next month’s sales.

Visualize the trend using a line chart.

Suggest adjustments based on observed trends (e.g., promotions, inventory).

Tool Used: Python (Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Statsmodels)

Highlights:

Forecasted next month’s sales using growth trends.

Visualized monthly trends for business decisions.

Recommended actionable insights to optimize sales.

Project 6: Movie Recommendation Based on User Ratings

Objective: Build a simple movie recommendation system.

Dataset: MovieLens Dataset (small version).

Tasks:

Analyze the most popular movies based on average ratings.

Group movies by genre and visualize the count of movies per genre.

Recommend top-rated movies in a specific genre to users.

Tool Used: Python (Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
